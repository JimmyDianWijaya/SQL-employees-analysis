# SQL-employees-analysis
This is a self-initiated SQL project to analyse different tables in a database known as 'employees'

In this project, I created some business questions/tasks that need to be addressed using MySQL:

1. Getting information on all female employees, whose first name is Kellie
2. Retrieving all employees named John, Mark or Jacob
3. Extract information on all employees, whose first name starts with 'Mark'
4. Extract a list of employees who were hired in the year 2000
5. Get a list of employees with 5 digits of employee number and starts with number '1000'
6. Inserting a new department record into the departments table. Call it Business Analysis - d010
7. Updating employee number 10163 title to Senior Engineer
8. What is the total amount of money spent on salaries for each employee starting after the 1st January 1997?
9. Retrieve a list containing information about all managers' employee code, names, department they responsible for and their hire date'
10. Get a list of employees who work as an Assistant Engineer
11. Create a stored procedure to generate the salary information for the employee in question
12. Create a function to generate the average salary of an employee

The tool involved in this project is MySQL and took approximately 2 hours to complete this project. 

This repository includes the SQL files; employees database and my SQL code. Feel free to download them to see how I approach these business tasks. 
Enjoy.
